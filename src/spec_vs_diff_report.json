  "summary": "The implementation successfully addresses all 7 requirements. The diff shows a complete start tracking application with Start/No Start/Reset buttons, count displays, percentage calculation with 4 decimal places, and a warm earth tone design using OKLCH color system (terracotta, sage green, cream) with Inter font. However, the BuildRequest specifies persistence across page refreshes, which requires verification beyond the static diff—the backend uses in-memory variables that would reset on canister restart, though local state persistence isn't explicitly shown in the diff.",
