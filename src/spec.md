# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Create a simple start tracking website that counts starts and no-starts, calculates the start percentage, and allows resetting the data.

**Planned changes:**
- Implement three buttons: Start, No Start, and Reset
- Display counters for starts and no-starts that update on button clicks
- Calculate and display start percentage as (starts / total attempts) × 100 with multiple decimal places
- Persist counts across page refreshes using local storage
- Design a clean, minimalist interface with warm earth tones (terracotta, sage green, cream), modern sans-serif typography, and generous spacing

**User-visible outcome:** Users can track starts vs no-starts by clicking buttons, see their counts and success percentage with decimal precision, reset all data, and experience a calming, focused interface with the data persisting between visits.
